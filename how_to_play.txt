DOS-CAVE is a simple game made using pygame. 
This document contains instructions about how to use.

Upon startup, you will be greeted with a Tkinter GUI window. It will have  level button(s), Exit, Character change,
and check for updates. Lets start with 

LEVEL BUTTONS
Clicking the level of your choice will start the associated game level (stored internally).

HOW TO PLAY

You are the person. Navigate with the arrow keys. (I am going to add a girl character soon for those
that want it). Your goal is to get to the green box (win) without touching any of the white obstacles.
Touching an obstacle will result in you dieing. You will than have to select the level to play again.

EXIT BUTTON
This will shutdown the app

EXIT IN GAME
You can exit to the menu by pressing escape while in the game. (bug with that fixed 0.1.1.3)
You can also do this by pressing the x in the corner of the screen.

CHECK FOR UPDATES
Using a pastebin, pressing this button will check for updates. If one is found, it will notify you and ask
if you want to download.

CHANGE TO _ CHRACTER
The light blue and pink buttons change your character. There is a girl and a boy character. You can make your own character
by overwriting the game files 'girl.png' and 'boy.png'. The character images are 40x100 pixels.
